## New features since Bear Upgrade 2.0

Bear Upgrade 2.1 will have a single frame for all Prusa versions (MK2S, MK2.5(S) and MK3(S)). This single frame is exactly the same frame than Full Bear 2.0 MK3 frame.

Bear 2.1 comes with a complete new Y axis with the following features:
  * New belt tensioner.
  * New stiffer Y motor mount.
  * New belt holder with clamping system.
  * Easier assembly of Y motor mount.
  * Creates a similar Y axis construction across all Bear frame.
  * T-nuts are placed were it is easy to swap them.
  * Compatible with E3D-Gates idlers.
  * Helps to reduce Y axis stepper noise for MK3(S).
  * Increase homing accuracy of MK3(S).
  * Y bearing holders are now as standard (not an optional part any more).

:warning: This a work in progress, the current kits sold by our official distributors are not containing the hardware necessary for this upgrade. The Bear Upgrade 2.1 is going to have new features that will require other modifications.



## Compatibility

:bulb: You do not need to upgrade the Bear frame if you come from Full Bear Upgrade 2.0 MK2S or MK2.5 frame to use the new Y axis. It is compatible with Full Bear MK2S and MK2.5 frames thanks to a special belt holder available in the [optional parts](optional_parts/y_belt_holder_for_bear2.0_mk2s_mk2.5_mk2.5s).

:bulb: You do not need to upgrade the Bear frame if you come from Full Bear Upgrade 2.0 MK3 frame.

:warning: The new Y axis is not compatible with any of the existing Prusa Y axis, you have to print all parts of this new Bear Y axis.

## Where can I purchase the hardware?

#### Official distributors

Official distributors are selling a kit with all screws and extrusions ready for the upgrade, you will only need to print latest 3D printed parts.

All distributors are following [specifications](doc/vslot_specs_tolerances.pdf) to ensure you will have a perfectly squared Bear. All distributors are using professional machines dedicated to cut aluminum extrusion (like CNC machines). In case your extrusion is out of specifications, you can get a replacement for free. We have created a dedicated support channel in case customers have more technical questions or need information for a custom build.
