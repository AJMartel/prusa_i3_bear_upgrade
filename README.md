## Where can I purchase the hardware?

#### Official distributors

Official distributors are selling a kit with all screws and extrusions ready for the upgrade, you will only need to print latest 3D printed parts.

All distributors are following [specifications](doc/vslot_specs_tolerances.pdf) to ensure you will have a perfectly squared Bear. All distributors are using professional machines dedicated to cut aluminum extrusion (like CNC machines). In case your extrusion is out of specifications, you can get a replacement for free. We have created a dedicated support channel in case customers have more technical questions or need information for a custom build.
