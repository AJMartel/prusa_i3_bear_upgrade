# Prusa i3 Bear Upgrade 2.1


:warning: **This is a development branch, use it at your own risk.** :warning:



## Introduction

This is a stiffer and more reliable frame for original [Prusa i3 MK2S, MK2.5(S) and MK3(S)](https://www.prusa3d.com/).

![Bear Upgrade MK3S](doc/rendering/mk3_home_left.jpg)



## New features since Bear Upgrade 2.0

  * Single frame for all Prusa versions (same frame as Full Bear 2.0 MK3)
  * New stiffer Y axis with tensioner.
  * Reduce Y axis stepper noise for MK3(S).
  * Increase Y axis homing accuracy of MK3(S).
  * Easier assembly of printed parts.
  * Support all Prusa's PSU.
  * Stiffer mounts for Rambo Mini/Einsy cover.
  * Compatible with E3D-Gates idlers as well as 9mm belt.

:warning: This a work in progress, the current kits sold by our official distributors are not containing the hardware necessary for this upgrade. The Bear Upgrade 2.1 is going to have new features that will require other modifications.



## Compatibility

:bulb: You do not need to upgrade the Bear frame if you come from Full Bear Upgrade 2.0 MK2S or MK2.5 frame to use the new Y axis. It is compatible with Full Bear MK2S and MK2.5 frames thanks to a special belt holder available in the [optional parts](optional_parts/y_belt_holder_for_bear2.0_mk2s_mk2.5_mk2.5s).

:bulb: You do not need to upgrade the Bear frame if you come from Full Bear Upgrade 2.0 MK3 frame.

:warning: The new Y axis is not compatible with none of the existing Prusa Y axis or Bear 2.0 Y axis parts. You have to update all Bear 2.1 Y axis parts.

## Optional parts

Official and community optional parts [are listed here](optional_parts).



## Where can I purchase an official kit?

Official distributors are selling a kit with all screws and extrusions ready for the upgrade, you will only need to print latest 3D printed parts.

All distributors are following [specifications](doc/vslot_specs_tolerances.pdf) to ensure you will have a perfectly squared Bear. All distributors are using professional machines dedicated to cut aluminum extrusion (like CNC machines). In case your extrusion is out of specifications, you can get a replacement for free. We have created a dedicated support channel in case customers have more technical questions or need information for a custom build.
