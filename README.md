## Introduction

The Bear Upgrade replaces the original [Prusa i3 MK2(S), MK2.5(S) and MK3(S)](https://www.prusa3d.com/) frame with a more rigid and reliable solution. It allows faster prints, increases precision, makes maintenance easier and opens the door to more customization. Plus it looks unique with our coloured frames!

## New features since Bear Upgrade 2.0

New and improved features in Bear Upgrade 2.1:
  * Single frame for all Prusa versions (same frame as Full Bear 2.0 MK3)
  * New stiffer Y axis with tensioner.
  * New stiffer Z axis.
  * Improve X and Y axis homing accuracy.
  * Improve Z axis alignment and assembly.
  * Reduce Y axis stepper noise for MK3(S).
  * Easier assembly of printed parts.
  * Support all Prusa PSU.
  * Shorter LCD supports.
  * Nicer and stronger end caps.
  * Stiffer mounts for Rambo Mini/Einsy cover.
  * Compatible with E3D Gates idlers as well as 9mm belt.

:warning: This a work in progress, the current kits sold by our official distributors are not containing the hardware necessary for this upgrade. The Bear Upgrade 2.1 is going to have new features that will require other modifications.



## Compatibility

This Bear Upgrade 2.1 is compatible with Full Bear Upgrade 2.0 __MK3__ frame. If you do not know which frame you have please check [our FAQ here](https://guides.bear-lab.com/Wiki/Bear_FAQ#Section_Which_Full_Bear_frame_do_I_have).

:bulb: If you have a Full Bear Upgrade 2.0 MK2S or MK2.5 frame you can find compatible parts here: [optional_parts/bear_2.0_upgrade_mk2-2s-2.5-2.5s](optional_parts/bear_2.0_upgrade_mk2-2s-2.5-2.5s).

:warning: The new Y and Z axis are not compatible with any of the existing Prusa or Bear 2.0 parts. You have to update all parts from Bear 2.1.

## Where can I get an official kit?

Official distributors are selling a kit with all screws and extrusions ready for the upgrade, you will only need to print latest 3D printed parts.

All distributors are following [specifications](doc/vslot_specs_tolerances.pdf) to ensure you will have a perfectly squared Bear. All distributors are using professional machines dedicated to cut aluminum extrusion (like CNC machines). In case your extrusion is out of specifications, you can get a replacement for free. We have created a dedicated support channel in case customers have more technical questions or need information for a custom build.
