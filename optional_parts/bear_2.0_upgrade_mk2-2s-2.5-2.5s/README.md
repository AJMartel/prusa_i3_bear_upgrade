# Prusa i3 Bear Upgrade 2.1

## Bear 2.1 upgrade parts for Full Bear 2.0 MK2(S)/MK2.5(S) frame

### Introduction

These parts allow you to upgrade your __Full Bear 2.0 MK2(S)/MK2.5(S) frame__ to similar parts than Bear 2.1. The new Bear 2.1 frame is based on the Full Bear 2.0 MK3 frame and is longer and taller than Full Bear 2.0 MK2(S)/MK2.5(S) frame.

These parts are __not__ compatible with Bear __2.1__ frame __for__ MK2(S)/MK2.5(S) original Prusa printers.


### Which frame do I have?

Measure the length of your Y axis **extrusion** as seen on the picture below.
  * If the length is **311 mm long** (±1mm) then you need the parts from the current page. Check _Download STL_ section below.
  * If the length is **331 mm long** (±1mm) then you can use the standard Bear 2.1 parts [here](../../printed_parts/).
